# * There are quite a few overrides in this file that are commented out. We are explicitly testing not including them,
#   so they are commented out for parity with the everything_disabled.json file. These should all be values that have
#   no default in the spec file, but are not required to be set. Variables that have a default value in the spec file
#   will be tested by another (less expensive) means.
